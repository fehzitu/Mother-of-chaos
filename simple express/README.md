## 🧠 Node.js Express Server
In this part I will continue to learn about servers but this time with express (a javascript framework), the base will be the simple server that is in the folder next door, after all, express does exactly that but in a simpler and more performant way to help with our development.

- Site: https://expressjs.com/

## 🤔 Express?
Our servers normally need to write each step manually right? The express shortens this walk, but it is important to know it both ways. With an http server without express we see how each thing happens and how to manipulate and work with it, the real problem is that this is not scalable and becomes too big and complex to maintain.

``Express aspects``:
- Simple routes
- Organization
- Scalable
- Minimalist
- Fast

"Everything starts simple", and with express it gets even more.

## 💡 How will it be done?
- We will use the http server as a base
- We will retrace all routes
- We will rebuild the controllers

## 🧰 Tech stack
- HTTP server (as inspiration)
- Express
- Nodemon (maybe not)

## 🧪 Example
Server running on port 3000 with express<br>
Open your browser or use curl and see things happen (again xD).

## 📝 Notes
- Maybe everything dont work xD
