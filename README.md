## 🖤 Mother of Chaos - Js Edition

> **Warning:** This repo contains pure magic, sorcery, and a lot of JS duct tape. Use at your own risk.

Welcome to the **mother folder** of all my JavaScript experiments! Inside, you'll find multiple child folders, each with a mini-project, hack, or random idea I coded to **learn JS the hard (and fun) way**. The goal is simple: become a professional JS dev by embracing chaos, console.log madness, and the art of pure improvisation.

## 💻 Structure

MotherOfChaos/<br>
├── project1/<br>
├── project2/<br>
└── ...more chaos neatly organized

Each folder is independent and self-contained. Minimal libraries, maximum curiosity, and a healthy dose of panic.

## 🪐 Philosophy

1- If it works, don’t touch it.<br>
2- If it doesn’t work, add more console.log.<br>
3- If nobody understands, write a funny README.<br>

## 📃 Next steps

1- Possibly organize the child folders (or not, depends on my mood)<br>
2- Add more experimental mini-projects<br>
3- Slowly replace chaos with skill and become a true JS wizard<br>

```🥀 Author’s note```**:**<br>
This repo is for learning and fun. If you were looking for perfect, production-ready code… go back to the MDN tutorials. Here, it’s all raw JavaScript and rebellious soul.

- Everything is built step by step
- Expect messy code at the beginning
- Growth is guaranteed, perfection is not
