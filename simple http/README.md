## 🧠 Node.js Server Playground — From Absolute Zero
A repository where I learn how servers actually work in Node.js, starting from **absolute zero**. No frameworks, no magic, just me, Node, and a lot of “why is this not working?” moments.

## 🤔 About this repo
This is my personal playground to:
- Learn how servers work under the hood
- Build HTTP servers from scratch using Node.js
- Understand requests, responses, headers, ports, and sockets
- Break things, fix them, and break them again
- Slowly stop being afraid of backend concepts 😅

Everything starts simple. Very simple.

## 💡 What lives here?
- Basic HTTP servers
- Raw request/response handling
- Experiments with routes (manually, like a caveman)
- Notes in code that future me will thank present me for
- Code that gets better… hopefully

## 🧰 Tech stack
- Node.js
- Pure JavaScript
- http module
- fs (because files always show up)
- patience

## 🚀 How to run
clone the repository:
git clone [repo-link]

enter the folder:
cd [repo-name]

run an example:
node server.js

If the server starts without errors, celebrate 🎉

## 🧪 Example
Server running on port 3000<br>
Open your browser or use curl and see things happen.
